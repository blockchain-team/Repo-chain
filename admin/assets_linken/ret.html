				<dl>
					<dt>Distribution Mechanism</dt>
					<dd>1.Total Volume：</dd>
					<dd>2385 houses will be built, and the value of each house is USD$275,000.0. Thus, the total value of the project is approximately USD$655mm. </dd>
					<dd>2.ICO Project:</dd>
					<dd>According to the total value of real estate project, 655,875,000 tokens will be issued in 2017, each token valued as USD$1. There are 13 phases in total, the first 12 phases will be issued USD$50,000,000.0 amount of RET, while the last phase will be issued USD$55,875,000.0 amount of RET. </dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>Exit Mechanism</dt>
					<dd>The number of RET issued for each property is constant.</dd>
					<dd>1. RET holders pay for their staying with RET and after the payment occurs, RET payment applies in global digitized real estate community. </dd>
					<dd>2. After the establishment of the ecosystem, abundant application scenarios allow RET holders to have multiple options of consumption.</dd>
					<dd>3. RET holders can trade RET on exchange platforms ( to exchange RET for other tokens or to sell RET for cash).</dd>
					<dd>4. When RET holders have the same amount of RET as the total RET-valued amount of land and houses, the title and property ownership of the houses selected will be transferred to them. </dd>
